This is my university project of the 1'st course. This is the game of checkers with basic randomised AI. 
Unfortunately, fields are not painted in different colors, and all of them are just "#" sign.

markings:
1 - 1'st player's peasant (in any gamemode, exept PvP is AI)
2 - 1'st player's king (also is AI in any mode, exept PvP)
3 - 2'nd player's peasant (is a human in any modes, except EvE)
4 - 2'nd player's king (human's king, except for EvE)

first turn is for the first player, which means in PVE AI always turns first.


Program requires an input to generate a random number for the AI to make moves.
